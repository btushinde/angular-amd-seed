angularAMD  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/marcoslin/angularAMD.png)](https://travis-ci.org/marcoslin/angularAMD)
==========
angularAMD is an utility that facilitate the use of RequireJS in AngularJS applications supporting on-demand loading
of 3rd party modules such as [angular-ui](git@github.com:marcoslin/bower-angularAMD.git).

Installation
==========
    bower install angularAMD

Usage
==========

http://marcoslin.github.io/angularAMD/ has been created as a working demo for `angularAMD`.  The source code
can be found in the `www/` directory of this project.

### RequireJS data-main

Starting point for any RequireJS app is a `main.js`, which should be used to define the components and their dependencies.  Use `deps` to kick off `app.js`:

```Javascript
require.config({
    baseUrl: "js",
    paths: {
        'angular': '//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.2.0-rc.2/angular.min',
        'angularAMD': 'lib/angularAMD.min',
        'ngload': 'lib/ngload.min'
    },
    shim: {
        'angularAMD': ['angular'],
        'ngload': ['angularAMD']
    },    
    deps: ['app']
});
```

###Â Bootstrapping AngularJS

Once components' dependencies has been defined, use a `app.js` to create AngularJS application and perform bootstrapping:

```Javascript
define(['angularAMD'], function (angularAMD) {
    var app = angular.module(app_name, ['webapp']);
    ... // Setup app here. E.g.: run .config with $routeProvider
    angularAMD.bootstrap(app);
    return app;
});
```

As bootstrapping is taking place manually, `ng-app` should not be used in HTML.  `angularAMD.bootstrap(app);` will take care of bootstraping AngularJS.

### On-Demand Loading of Controllers

Use `angularAMD.route` when configuring routes using `$routeProvider` to enable on-demand loading of controllers:

```Javascript
app.config(function ($routeProvider) {
$routeProvider.when(
    "/home",
    angularAMD.route({
        templateUrl: 'views/home.html',
        controller: 'HomeController',
        controllerUrl: 'scripts/controller.js'
    })
);
});
```

You can avoid passing of `controllerUrl` if you define it in your `main.js` as:

```Javascript
paths: { 'HomeController': 'scripts/controller.js' }
```

The primary purpose of `angularAMD.route` is set `.resolve` property to load controller using `require` statement.
Any attribute you pass into this method will simply be returned, with exception of `controllerUrl`. 


### Creating a Module

All subsquent module definition would simply need to require `app` dependency and use `app.register` property to create
desired AngularJS services:

```Javascript
define(['app'], function (app) {
    app.register.factory('Pictures', function (...) {
        ...
    });
});
```

Here is the list of methods supported by `app.register`:

* `.controller`
* `.factory`
* `.service`
* `.constant`
* `.value`
* `.directive`
* `.filter`
* `.animation` **

** `.animation` is not covered in unit test for now

### 3rd Party AngularJS Modules

3rd party AngularJS module, meaning any module created using `angular.module` syntax, can be loaded as any normal JavaScript file *before* `angularAMD.bootstrap` is called.  After bootstraping, any AngularJS module must be loaded using the included `ngload` RequireJS plugin.

```Javascript
define(['app', 'ngload!dataServices'], function (app) {...});
```

In case you need to load your module using RequireJS plugin or if you have complex dependecies, you can create a wrapper RequireJS module as below:

```Javascript
define(['angularAMD', 'ui-bootstrap'], function (angularAMD) {
    angularAMD.processQueue();
});
```

In this case, all depdencies will be queued up and when `.processQueue()` is called, it will go through the queued and copy them into current app using `app.register`:


Running Sample Project
==========

Run the following command after cloning this project:

```bash
npm install
grunt build
grunt serve-www
```
* The default build will test angularAMD using following browsers: 'PhantomJS', 'Chrome' and 'Firefox'

History
==========
This project was inpired by [Dan Wahlin's blog](http://weblogs.asp.net/dwahlin/archive/2013/05/22/dynamically-loading-controllers-and-views-with-angularjs-and-requirejs.aspx)
where he explained the core concept of what is needed to make RequireJS works with AngularJS.  It is a *must* read
if you wish to better understand implementation detail of `angularAMD`.

As I started to implement RequireJS in my own project, I got stuck trying to figure out how to load my existing modules
without re-writting them.  After exhausive search with no satisfactory answer, I posted following question on 
[StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19134023/lazy-loading-angularjs-modules-with-requirejs).
[Nikos Paraskevopoulos](http://stackoverflow.com/users/2764255/nikos-paraskevopoulos) was kind enough to share his
solution with me but his implementation did not handle `.config` method calls and out of order definition in modules.
However, his implementation gave me the foundation I needed to create `angularAMD` and his project is where the idea
for `alt_angular` came from.
